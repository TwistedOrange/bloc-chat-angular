<!-- Display each room in the database by referencing
the controller-as name 'home' which has the service called Room as a dependency. This service exposes properties and methods as needed by views.

Ex: variable 'oneRoom' is any name I choose that holds one instance of the list being traversed. The data held in variable 'oneRoom' is provided by the service Room (see the dependencies injected into the controller HomeCtrl).

`home.listRooms` uses the controller-as name 'home' with the properties or methods exposed by the dependent service Room through $scope.
