<!-- Display each room in the database by referencing
the controller-as name 'home' which has the service called Room as a dependency. This service exposes properties and methods as needed by views.

Ex: variable 'oneRoom' is any name I choose that holds one instance of the list being traversed. The data held in variable 'oneRoom' is provided by the service Room (see the dependencies injected into the controller HomeCtrl).

`home.listOfRooms` uses the controller-as name 'home' with the properties or methods exposed by the dependent service Room through $scope.

Using {{ oneRoom.$value }} because that's the property exposed from Firebase. To see this do console.log() in the controller.
 -->
<div class='roomList' ng-repeat="oneRoom in home.listOfRooms">{{ oneRoom.name}}</div>

{{ home.oneRoom }}

<p>After added room, new list</p>
<div class='roomList' ng-repeat="myRoom in home.listOfRooms">{{ myRoom.$value }}</div>
