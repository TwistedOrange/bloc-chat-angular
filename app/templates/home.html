<!-- Display each room in the database by referencing
the controller-as name 'home' which has the service called Room as a dependency. This service exposes properties and methods as needed by views.

Ex: variable 'oneRoom' is placeholder which stores one instance of the list being traversed. The data held in variable 'oneRoom' is provided by the service Room (see dependencies injected into the controller HomeCtrl).

`home.listOfRooms` uses the controller-as name 'home' with the properties or methods exposed by the dependent service Room through $scope.

Using {{ oneRoom.$value }} because that's the property exposed from Firebase. To see this do console.log() in the controller.
 -->
 Show list of rooms:
<div class='roomList' ng-repeat="oneRoom in home.listOfRooms">{{ oneRoom.$value }}</div>

<!-- <p>something here</p>
<div ng-repeat="myRoom in home.listOfRooms">{{ myRoom.$value }}</div> -->
